# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project
We are to rewrite the code to make it more efficient. 

### Purpose
In this challenge we had to edit or as the assignment suggests refactor the module code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information we had previously collected. The purpose of this, was in order to run the code or script faster. Then we are to determine whether the code did in fact run faster and explain our findings. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The challenge was to use the ticker index function to help go through the data faster.  The challenge was also to get the new version or the new code to run without issues.  Trial an error helps troubleshoot until you get it to work the way you need it.

## Results

I found that refactoring improved not only the speed, but the clarity.  It was cleaner and easier to follow, making debugging that mush easier. The amount of runtime went down was significant.

Previous runtimes were 0.27 compared to the new runtimes of 0.08.
